# News-App
# [Your News App Name]

## Description

This is an Android news application that fetches international news from the [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) using the [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) library for handling API calls. The app provides users with the latest international news articles, allowing them to stay informed about global events.

## Key Features

* **Fetches International News:** Retrieves news articles specifically categorized as international from the NewsAPI.
* **Multiple News Sources:** Leverages the variety of news sources available on the NewsAPI to provide a diverse range of perspectives.
* **Retrofit Integration:** Uses Retrofit, a type-safe HTTP client for Android, to simplify the process of making network requests to the NewsAPI.
* **JSON Parsing:** Automatically parses the JSON response from the NewsAPI into usable data structures within the app.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** [Describe the basic UI elements, e.g., Displays a list of news articles with titles, descriptions, and source information. Allows users to tap on an article to view the full content (possibly in a web view).]
* **[Optional Feature]:** [Add any other features your app might have, e.g., Search functionality, filtering by category or source, saving articles, etc.]

## Technologies Used

* **Android:** The native platform for the application.
* **Kotlin/Java:** The primary programming language used for development.
* **Retrofit:** A library for making type-safe HTTP requests.
* **NewsAPI:** A RESTful API for fetching news articles from various sources.
* **[Mention any other libraries used, e.g., Gson for JSON conversion, Picasso/Glide for image loading, RecyclerView for displaying lists, etc.]**

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Android Studio installed on your development machine.
    * A stable internet connection.
    * (Optional) A physical Android device or an Android emulator.

2.  **Get a NewsAPI API Key:**
    * Visit the [NewsAPI website](https://newsapi.org/) and sign up for a free developer account.
    * Once registered, you will receive a unique API key. **Keep this key secure.**

3.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
    cd [YOUR_APP_DIRECTORY]
    ```
    *(Replace `[YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]` with the actual URL of your project repository and `[YOUR_APP_DIRECTORY]` with the name of the cloned directory.)*

4.  **Add Your NewsAPI API Key:**
    * Open your Android project in Android Studio.
    * Navigate to the file where you are making the NewsAPI requests. This might be in a configuration file, a constant file, or directly in your API service interface.
    * Locate the place where the API key is used and replace the placeholder with your actual NewsAPI API key.
    * **Example (in Kotlin):**
        ```kotlin
        object Constants {
            const val BASE_URL = "[https://newsapi.org/v2/](https://newsapi.org/v2/)"
            const val API_KEY = "YOUR_NEWSAPI_KEY" // Replace with your actual API key
        }
        ```
    * **Example (in Java):**
        ```java
        public class Constants {
            public static final String BASE_URL = "[https://newsapi.org/v2/](https://newsapi.org/v2/)";
            public static final String API_KEY = "YOUR_NEWSAPI_KEY"; // Replace with your actual API key
        }
        ```

5.  **Build and Run the Application:**
    * In Android Studio, go to `Build > Make Project` to build the application.
    * Once the build is successful, run the application on a connected Android device or an emulator by going to `Run > Run 'app'` or by clicking the run icon.

## Usage

1.  Open the application on your Android device or emulator.
2.  The app will automatically fetch the latest international news articles from the NewsAPI.
3.  You will see a list of news headlines, possibly with short descriptions and the source of the news.
4.  Tap on a news item to view the full article content. This might open the content within the app or redirect you to the original news website in a web view.
5.  [If your app has additional features like search or filtering, explain how to use them here.]

## Retrofit API Service Interface (Example)

You will likely have an interface defined using Retrofit annotations to interact with the NewsAPI. Here's a basic example of what it might look like:

```kotlin
import retrofit2.Call
import retrofit2.http.GET
import retrofit2.http.Query

interface NewsApiService {
    @GET("top-headlines")
    fun getInternationalNews(
        @Query("country") country: String = "us", // Example: Fetching US international news
        @Query("category") category: String = "general", // Example: General news category
        @Query("apiKey") apiKey: String = Constants.API_KEY
    ): Call<NewsResponse>

    // You might have other API calls defined here for different endpoints or queries
}
